## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If test fails:**
1. Check that you have at least one application in the database
2. Verify Django is properly configured
3. Check file permissions for the media directory
4. Review Django logs for detailed error messages

**If PDF content looks wrong:**
1. Ensure the application has complete data
2. Check that commodities, next of kin, and other related data exist
3. Verify the application status is not draft

The test is working correctly if you see "PDF generated successfully!" and can open the generated PDF file! 🎉
