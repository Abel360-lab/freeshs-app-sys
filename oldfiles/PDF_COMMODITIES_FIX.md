# PDF Commodities Display Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The PDF generation service was showing all commodities as unchecked (☐) instead of displaying the actual commodities selected during the application process.

**Previous behavior:**
```
INTERESTED COMMODITIES
Instructions: Selected Commodities displayed below
☐ Maize ☐ Soya ☐ Cashew
☐ Sesame ☐ Sorghum ☐ Rice
☐ Shea ☐ Cowpea
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated `_add_commodities_section` Method**
The PDF service now correctly retrieves and displays the actual selected commodities from the application.

**Key changes:**
- ✅ **Dynamic commodity retrieval**: Gets actual commodities from `application.commodities_to_supply.all()`
- ✅ **Checkmark display**: Shows selected commodities with ☑ symbols
- ✅ **Complete list**: Displays both table format and complete list
- ✅ **Additional commodities**: Includes `other_commodities` field if present

### 2. **New PDF Structure**
**Current behavior:**
```
INTERESTED COMMODITIES
Instructions: Selected Commodities displayed below

Selected Commodities:
☑ Gari ☑ Hot Chocolate ☑ Margarine
☑ Milk ☑ Peanuts ☑ Soya bean

Complete List of Selected Commodities:
☑ Gari, Hot Chocolate, Margarine, Milk, Peanuts, Soya bean
```

### 3. **Code Changes Made**

#### Before (Hardcoded List):
```python
# Common commodities list
common_commodities = ['Maize', 'Soya', 'Cashew', 'Sesame', 'Sorghum', 'Rice', 'Shea', 'Cowpea']

commodity_rows = []
for i in range(0, len(common_commodities), 3):
    row = []
    for j in range(3):
        if i + j < len(common_commodities):
            commodity = common_commodities[i + j]
            checkbox = '☑' if commodity in selected_names else '☐'  # Always ☐
            row.append(f'{checkbox} {commodity}')
```

#### After (Dynamic Selection):
```python
# Get actually selected commodities
commodities_selected = list(application.commodities_to_supply.all())
selected_names = [c.name for c in commodities_selected]

if commodities_selected:
    # Display selected commodities with checkmarks
    story.append(Paragraph("Selected Commodities:", self.styles['field_label']))
    
    # Create table for selected commodities
    commodity_rows = []
    for i in range(0, len(selected_names), 3):
        row = []
        for j in range(3):
            if i + j < len(selected_names):
                commodity = selected_names[i + j]
                row.append(f'☑ {commodity}')  # Always ☑ for selected
```
